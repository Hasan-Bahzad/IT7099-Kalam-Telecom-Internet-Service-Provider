## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world carrier-grade ISP routing with MPLS:
- Scalable routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, MP-BGP)
- Label Switching Technique (MPLS)
- Inter-AS MPLS VPN Network
- IP addressing

## How to Use This Repository 

**If you’re studying or reviewing this project:**
1. Open the **Network Topology** diagram to understand Infrastructure layout.
2. Load the appropriate configurations into your simulator of choice.
3. Use the CLI configs to step through:
   - Routing
   - Security
   - Connectivity checks
4. Compare your own setup against the configs in the Repository.

## Recommended Tools

- **EVE-NG** for topology/simulation
- Cisco CLI (IOL)  
- Ping, traceroute, and **show/debug** commands for verification
